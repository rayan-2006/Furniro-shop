    "description": "The Aura Round Marble Dining Table is a timeless icon of mid-century modern design. At its center is a stunning 48-inch circular top made from solid, hand-selected Carrara marble. Each tabletop is unique, featuring the natural grey veining and crystalline structures that have made Italian marble a favorite of designers for centuries. The marble is honed for a smooth, matte finish and treated with a high-performance sealant to resist staining. Supporting this heavy stone top is a classic tulip-style pedestal base, crafted from heavy-duty cast aluminum with a crisp white powder-coated finish. This pedestal design eliminates the clutter of traditional table legs, providing maximum legroom for up to four guests. The round shape encourages conversation and creates a more intimate dining experience. Whether placed in a breakfast nook or a dedicated dining room, the Aura table serves as a sophisticated focal point that bridges the gap between classic luxury and modern minimalism.",

Each table is unique, featuring a massive slab of solid American walnut with the original 'live edge' of the tree preserved. This means the natural curves, knots, and textures of the timber are the stars of the design, providing a one-of-a-kind organic look. The wood is meticulously sanded and finished with a durable, low-sheen clear coat that protects against spills while maintaining the raw beauty of the grain. To contrast the organic top, the table features a bold, industrial-style U-frame base made from heavy-duty cast iron with a textured black finish. This combination of natural wood and raw metal creates a striking aesthetic that works beautifully in modern, industrial, or rustic-chic homes. Large enough to seat eight comfortably, the Horizon is designed to be the centerpiece of your dining room, where families gather and memories are made for years to come.",
